# CRITICAL FIX - Installation Progress Now VISIBLE!

## The Problem I Fixed

**You were right to be frustrated.** The installation progress was completely hidden because:

1. `postCreateCommand` runs **in the background** during codespace creation
2. Its output goes to `/workspaces/.codespaces/.persistedshare/creation.log` (hidden)
3. Users only see "Installing Dotfiles" in terminal with NO updates
4. This causes anxiety: "Is it working or hanging??"

## The Solution

I created a **VISIBLE status file** that appears in VS Code file explorer:

**`/workspaces/DOTFILES-INSTALLATION-STATUS.txt`**

This file:
- ✅ Appears **IMMEDIATELY** when codespace starts
- ✅ Shows up at the **TOP** of your file explorer
- ✅ Updates in **REAL-TIME** with all progress
- ✅ You can **OPEN and REFRESH** it to watch installation
- ✅ Shows **COMPLETION** status when done

## What You'll See Now

### 1. When Codespace First Starts (0-10 seconds)
You'll see a new file appear in the file explorer:
```
📄 DOTFILES-INSTALLATION-STATUS.txt
```

### 2. Open That File
Click on it and you'll see:
```
